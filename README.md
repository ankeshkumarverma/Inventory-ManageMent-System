# Inventory-Management-System
In this Project we are creating Inventory management using Python Dictionaries
This repository is having all files used in Inventory-Management-System Project.

# Code Files
IMS_Adding_Product.ipynb
Purchasing.ipynb

# Overview
In this Project there are modules-
AddNewProduct()
DeleteARecord()
Purchase and update inventory()
Sales()

# Brief Dicription
The Inventory Management system is used to manage store products and keep
track of all goods stock and also we can use it to check the purchases history of the
store. So by using this system we can keep record data of products and even all
purchases happened in-store.


In this task we are creating Inventory management System using Python Dictionaries
which involves modules – AddNewProduct in inventory, DeleteARecord of product,
Purchase & Update inventory record and create the sales file for the record purpose,
record is dumped into JSON file. So we are going to develop an inventory
management system using python and for storing data we are going to use JSON
files. We will open JSON files on each function and loading JSON data in python
dictionary format and again reverse the process of converting dictionary data back
to JSON format then closing the file.


There are python files in this task that we createCreating Data and Adding In JSON File- In this we are creating the dictionary of
records of product in which each product having specific features as Prod_id, Name
, qn, pr, brand , category , color, customer_rating, ideal_for, made_in, size, type)
